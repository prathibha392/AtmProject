This paper presents the design and implementation of a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) user interface using Java. 
The system provides a console-based interaction where users can perform essential banking transactions such as checking account balance, withdrawing funds, depositing money, and viewing a mini-statement. 
The authentication mechanism ensures secure access by verifying the ATM number and PIN before allowing transactions. 
The implementation follows an object-oriented approach, utilizing a separate class (AtmOperationImpl) to handle core banking operations. 
This system serves as a foundational model for ATM software, demonstrating fundamental Java programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, and user input handling via the Scanner class.
